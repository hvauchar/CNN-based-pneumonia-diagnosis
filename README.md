Code base for Problem Statement Title Diagnosing COVID-19 using AI-based medical image analyses SAMHAR-COVID19 Hackathon
Download the kaggle dataset from the link below and put the zip file in folder with name train and then unzip the dataset

https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

DataAnalysis.ipynb contains the analysis done on the dataset along with the results.

Kaggle_CNN_COVID19_TransferLearning.ipynb contains the results if Transfer learning applied on our dataset with using pretrained architectures like mobileNet and vgg16.

augmentation_Kaggle_CNN_COVID19.ipynb contain details regarding the image augmentation techniques used and code for the same.

I highly suggest to run the code on google colab rather on your local machine.

If you opt to run it on your local machine do the following

1. clone the repository to your local machine and unzip it.

2. Download the dataset from the link metioned above and unzip it in the code repository. 

3. open terminal window in the directory where you have dumped all the github code and then run the below command to install all the required packages.

`$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`
